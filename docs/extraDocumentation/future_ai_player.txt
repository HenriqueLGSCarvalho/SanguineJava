My plan for creating and implementing a user-player AI interface is still in its very early stages.

My early thoughts are have an AI which checks for all moves within the board, and picks the first
valid move it finds, if it cannot find a valid move it will skip. Obviously this would make for
the smartest AI player, but I feel like find a way to implement that will be a solid start in
understanding how to design these AIs.

Another thought would be to have my AI pick a move based on spreading the highest amount of
influence. This seems like it will be harder, but maybe achievable, and would definitely make for
a slightly smarter AI.

I will definitely be giving this more thought throughout the next few weeks as well.
