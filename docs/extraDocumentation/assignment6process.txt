Maybe at some point:
  - Go through all observer methods and ensure they cannot be used for mutations
  - Potentially add more observers if needed for the view
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
1) Create View:
   - Key Concepts to keep in kind: PubSub Pattern, Coordinate Conversion, JFrame library
   - Needs at least an interface & model implementing that interface

What should be apparent in the view?
  - which player is playing
  - what cards are in their hand along with influence grids of those cards
  - where the board is
  - what cells belong to the red player, which to the blue player, and which to neither
  - how many pawns are on a cell without a card
  - the value scores of any card already on the board
  - the row-scores for each player

Useful Class Libraries:
  - JFrame
  - JPanel
  - Graphics2D
  - Graphics
  - Font

Note: you cannot print newlines with drawString

Required Behavior:
  - View must have a constructor that takes in a ReadOnlySanguineModel
      - Ensures that the view is incapable of modifying the model (even accidentally)
  - View should be able to handle: mouse clicks & key presses
      - Will need a stub controller to stand in for the real one and respond to events

Mouse Clicks & Key Presses:
  - User should be able to click on a card, which should highlight the card
      - your stub controller should print a message (using System.out)
        containing the index of the card that was clicked on as well as which player owns that hand.
  - User should be able to click on a cell in the grid, which should highlight the cell
      - the stub controller should print a message (using System.out) containing
        the coordinates of the cell that was clicked on, in whatever coordinate system
        you used in your model (likely in [row, cell] format).
  - User should be able to indicate they want to confirm their move or pass by handling
    keyboard input
      - the stub controller should print a message (using System.out)
        printing whether the key press indicated a confirmation or a pass.
      - Document in README which keys correspond to confirming a move and passing a turn
  - User should be able to deselect a selected card in hand or selected cell on the board by
      - Clicking on it again OR
      - Clicking on another card
      - Note: Clicking outside the boundary of the grid or the hand must not cause
              your view to crash, throw an exception, or otherwise break.
  - General Note: Whenever resizing the window to be larger or smaller, all of the above
                  functionality should still work correctly

Running the View:
  - Add the following placeholder class to your project
        public final class SanguineGame {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
            YourModel model = ...create an example model...
            YourView view = new YourView(model);
            ...whatever other setup you need...
            view.setVisible(true); //or the equivalent in your system
          }
        }
  - As we've done several times, our main() method simply instantiates a model, instantiates a view
    using that model, instantiates anything else needed, and tells the view to get started.
    For this main method, read your example deck configuration file in from HW5 and use the
    resulting deck for both players (meaning red and blue have copies of the exact same deck).
    This will ensure a way you can create a view for screenshots and for us to test
    the functionality described above. Aside from that, anything else can be done in this
    main method so long as the game is not over when the view is launched.

1.1) Testing The View

For this assignment, we do not need to unit-test the visual view.
  - However, in submission, we must include at least 4 screenshots of the view
      - each screenshot being of a 5 row, 7 column game

Screenshot 1:
  - At the start of the game
Screenshot 2:
  - With a card and cell selected from the Red Player's hand on their turn
    during the start of the game
Screenshot 3:
  - With a card selected from the Blue Player's hand on their turn
    during their first turn of the game
Screenshot 4:
  - At a non-trivial intermediate point of the game,
    meaning cards have been played by both players

  - Make sure to name the screenshot appropriately
  - Make sure the screenshots are reasonably sized
  - No need for a 4k PNG of the view!

2) Create View Model:
     - Implements ReadOnlySanguineModel
     - Composition from SanguineModel (or maybe BasicSanguine)
     - Have the view in Main method take in a new view, which takes in a new ViewModel(model).
