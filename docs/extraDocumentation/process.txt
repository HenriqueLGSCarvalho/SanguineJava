BASIC OVERVIEW:

Facts of the Game:
  - Two players; red and blue
  - Each player gets a deck of cards
  - Each player has a hand of cards made from their respective decks

Start Game:
  - Each player must be given a deck of cards to play with
  - Player's hand size must be chosen, and then cards must be distributed to hand from the deck
  - The board must be constructed
  - Board starts empty, Except:
    - Cells in the first column start with a single pawn in each cell (belongs to the red player)
    - Cells in the last column start with a single pawn in each cell (belongs to the blue player)

Deck of Cards:
  - Must be enough cards in each deck to possibly fill every cell on the board
  - Can only be TWO copies of any card in a deck (duplicates allowed, triplets not allowed)
  - The deck for each player will be read in from a separate file (???)

Board:
  - Rectangular
  - Dimensions must be specified before the game starts
  - Number of rows must be positive (greater than 0)
  - Number of columns must be greater than 1, and must be odd (3, 5, 7, 9, etc.)

Player's hand:
  - Size of the hand cannot be greater than 1/3rd of the deck size

Game Play:
  - 1) Both players are dealt an equal number of cards to their hand from their respective decks
       - cards are dealt randomly from each player's respective deck into their hand
  - 2) Player Red always starts
  - 3) Typical Turn
       - Current player first draws a card from their deck
       - If there are no cards remaining in the deck, then no card is drawn
       - Then they take an action
         - Pass: Current Player's turn ends, and the current player becomes the other player
         - Place a Card: 1) To place a card, the player must place their card in a cell that has
                            that has enough of their own pawns to cover the cost of the card.
                         2) The newly placed card can then affect the board by adding pawns to other
                            cells or converting pawns from the opponent's ownership to the current
                            player's ownership
                         3) Once a card is successfully played, the turn changes to the next player
  - 4) Game ends when both players pass their turn, one right after the other,
       The winner is determined by calculating the score of each row

CARDS - IN DEPTH:

Each Card has:
  - Name
  - Cost: One, Two, or Three pawns
  - Value Score: any positive integer, used to determine the overall score of the game
  - 5 by 5 board: Demonstrates the card's influence on the actual game board
    - Orange Square: the card itself (C)
    - Cyan Square: it affects the cell relative to where the card is placed on the board (I)
    - Grey Square: Nothing happens on those cells (X)
  * The name, cost, and score are all depicted in text on the card itself

Card Equality
  - Two cards are the same if they have the same name, cost, value score, and influence grid

Supplying Cards:
  - We will be supplying cards to the game via files that contain the decks for each player.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________
BOARD - IN DEPTH:

Board is a Rectangular container of cells

Cells:
  - Can contain pawns, cards, or nothing
  - Each cell can contain between 0 - 3 pawns
  - If a cell has a pawn or card, then it is owned by one of the players
    - cells with cards cannot change ownership
    - cells with pawn can change ownership, depending on the cards the current turn player places
      on the board
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
SCORING THE GAME - IN DEPTH:

Score Calculation: Each row tallies the scores for each player
  - "Row scores": calculated by summing the value scores of each card owned by that player
  - We know which players owns which card by looking at the color of the cell
  - each player's Total Score should be calculable at any point in the game

Calculating "Row Scores" & Total Score
  - (1) Examine each Row's Scores for each player
  - (2.1) The player with the higher row score adds the score of that row to their total score
  - (2.2) The player with the lower row score gains 0 points for their total score
  - (2.3) If both player's have an equal row score, both gain 0 points for their total score
  - (3) Repeat step 2 & add up all of each player's total score
  - (4.1) The player with the higher total score wins
  - (4.2) If both players with an equal score the game ends in a tie
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
PLACING A CARD - IN DEPTH:

A player can place a card from their hand onto a cell if:
  - the cell contains pawns the player owns AND
  - the cell contains at least enough pawns to cover the cost of the card

If both conditions are met:
  - The pawns on that cell are removed
  - The card is placed on that cell (and removed from the player's hand)

If either condition is not met:
  - The player must choose another card that does satisfy both conditions
  - If none of the cards on hand satisfy the conditions, the player must pass their turn
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
CARDS INFLUENCE ON BOARD - IN DEPTH:

Once a card is placed, the card's influence spreads on the board
according to that card's influence grid

Grey cells:
  - The grey cells represent the remaining cells in the example board (no influence from card)

Orange cells:
  - The orange cell represents the cell the card is being placed on (no influence from card)

Cyan cells:
  - The cyan cells represent the cells which are influenced by the card (influence from card)

Influence:
  - Each cell has a card, pawns, or nothing; influence works differently for each.
  - Influence on cell containing a Card:
    - Nothing happens
  - Influence on cell containing Nothing:
    - The cell gains a single pawn (owned by the current turn player)
  - Influence on a cell containing pawns:
    - If the current player owns the pawns
      - The number of pawns on that cell increases by one (maximum of 3 pawns)
    - If the current player does not own the pawns:
      - The number of pawns stay the same
      - the current player steals ownership of the pawns in that cell

Influence off-grid:
  - A card's influence could potentially affect a cell which is outside of the board
    - In this instance, the card will simply not exercise its influence for those cells
    - A card will only influence cells that are on the board

Influence on same card, but different player:
  - Since red and blue start on different sides, the influence grid is mirrored across
    the columns (i.e. Y-Intercept)

READING DECK CONFIGURATION FILES - IN DEPTH:

We will be using configuration files to instantiate the grid and cards for our game.

For this section, it may be helpful to read up on the
FileReader and Scanner documentation from Oracle.

Windows uses "\" to separate folders while Macs and Linux use "/"

...
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
BASIC VIEW:

We recommend a straightforward rendering of the board itself and the row-scores,
  - using _ for empty cells,
  - an integer of 1, 2, or 3 for the number of pawns on the board,
  - R for a card owned by the red player,
  - and B for a card owned by the blue player.

Example:
  2 RR__3 0
  0 2__1B 1
  0 11_1B 3
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
CONTROLLER:

No need to implement a controller for this assignment, but consider how you will in the future
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Possible AI:

You do not have to implement a computer user-player right now,
but you should design your model so that different user-player implementations could exist for human
or machines to play your game.
You should attempt to design a user-player interface that allows this to happen.
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
Further notes that may help in future assignments:

- the game sanguine is based on has different types of influence,
  like increasing or decreasing the value scores of cards.
  (this is not yet to be implemented, just good to keep in mind)

- And then there are the user-players (an object that the users actually play the game through),
  which are not part of the model, view, or controller.
  User-players make decisions about what move they want to make
  (not be confused with the player entities of Red and Blue in the model),
  so they "have a different interface" than the other components discussed so far.
